The goal is to leverage data analysis techniques to support restaurant owners and stakeholders in making informed decisions.

## Key Objectives:

Analyze restaurant performance metrics to identify growth opportunities.

Understand customer preferences and behaviors based on ratings and reviews.

Evaluate the impact of various factors (e.g., cuisine type, location, price) and performance metrics such as average cost for two, rating, and number of reviews on restaurant success.

## Tools:

### Excel: 
For data manipulation and analysis.

### SQL: 
To query and analyze data stored in relational databases.

### Data Visualization: 
Created dashboards and visualizations using Power BI and Tableau.


## Key Features:

### Data Collection and Cleaning:

Gathered data from Zomatoâ€™s API and public datasets, including restaurant information, reviews, and ratings.

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using Python (Pandas) to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted EDA to visualize key trends in restaurant ratings, cuisines, and customer demographics.
Created visualizations using Power BI and Tableau to uncover patterns and insights, such as the most popular cuisines and the average rating per locality.


### Pricing Strategy Analysis:

Examined the relationship between pricing and customer ratings to propose competitive pricing strategies.
Developed visualizations to illustrate how pricing impacts customer perception and restaurant performance.
